If you're here, you've probably seen my videos before. If not, welcome! I’m Swagaruney, a [content creator](https://www.youtube.com/@swagaruney) who explores many different types of creative design and inspirations. I created this site so I wouldn't have to share a ton of videos just to get my name out there for people. Instead, I can present all of my work in one place when i find it convenient, making it easier to share projects and keep everything organized for others to view and follow. This platform will serve as the central hub for all my future creations and projects, including my portfolio and story, which I’ll be sharing with my community!

Number 1: Basics
======
At a very young age I was given a laptop, specifically a toshiba, very bad windows 7, probably used years before me! I became interested in anything virtual, I loved making games and playing them, mostly roblox studio and minecraft were the biggest parts of my life, because I was mostly detached from sports or working out, which i now balance in my everyday life. 
  I was stuck in a point of making random texture packs in minecraft, weird games on roblox etc, until a game came out called [*Friday Night Funkin,*](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/770371) it was very new to me, being a game that you actually use your arrow keys in and all. It was rapidly increasing in popularity, a rhythm game in which you have to use four keys to hit notes as they fly up the strums.

Number 2: Rising Action
======
After a few months, the community started realizing the potential of creating an infinite amount of modifications based on different fandoms and characters, I got interested as well. As I begun to travel to multiple websites to research using different engines that have been created, I came across [Psych Engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine/releases), a higher quality engine than the old ones used before, it included a LUA JUST-IN-TIME compiler, which enhances the performance basically, so you could type in LUA and use functions that were built into the game other than just using HaxeScript, I started studying haxe in the beginning, realizing it was too much for me at the time, especially being so dull-minded at the time, I moved to the simpler and smaller "version" of haxe that would still give me some knowledge down the road, which is what I like to call LUA! After learning about an average amount of functions, and gaining a huge amount of knowledge, thinking that I knew enough, which i didn't, I made a modification based on a character from portal 2 called wheatley.

**note**: This is Wheatley below.

Number 3: Inciting Incident
======
Like I said in Number 2, I had the issue of jumping into projects too soon, creating a modification was harder than I thought. Though, my team was pretty awesome to have, I made alot of friends, we had issues with artists, and sadly went on hiatus indefinitely until I create it personally on my own with a composer that still enjoys the mod.

IF YOU SEE THIS. THIS IS PLACERHOLDER AND YOU'RE HERE EARLY XD

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
