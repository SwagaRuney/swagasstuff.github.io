title: "Friday Night Funkin' - Broken Strings"
excerpt: "FNF: Broken Strings is an upcoming mod for the popular rhythm game Friday Night Funkin'. Created by ThoMitDraws, this mod is inspired by various puppet and costumed character shows like Don't Hug Me I'm Scared, Sesame Street, The Muppets, and more. The mod features a series of songs where players face off against corrupted versions of beloved characters from these shows.

> **Note**: I am yet to receive any large/meaningful work for Broken Strings, but hopefully you'll see my work in the finished product!

One of my favorite mods that I am currently working on, features phenomenal music and an exceptional team. As of March 13, 2025, the date of me writing this, I am pleased to note that there has been no drama, and everyone involved has demonstrated remarkable humor and professionalism.
