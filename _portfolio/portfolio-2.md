excerpt: "HorrorTale Infernal Harmony is a mod for Friday Night Funkin' (FNF) that explores the alternate universe of Undertale known as Horrortale. In this universe, the monsters trapped underground face extreme hardships, including famine, after a neutral ending in the original Undertale game. The mod features intense rap battles with characters like Horror!Sans, who appears in songs such as Macabre Meetin', Blood N' Bones, and Slasher's Feast.

> **Note**: Most of my work was replaced for this, but was redesigned with my supervision!

One of my more popularized mods, at first i honestly didnt expect this to blow up like it did.The mod team had ups and downs, but over-all it was fun to be a part of! I did mostly concept animation and coding for all the stages, I also did concepts for the stages but i'm honestly unaware if they were revised or kept ;-; I'm assuming they were kept due to an event still happening to the bopping characters during Slasher's Feast.
