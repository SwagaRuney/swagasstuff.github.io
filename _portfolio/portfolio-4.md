title: "Battle for Corrupted Island"
excerpt: "Battle for Corrupted Island (BFCI) is a fan-made mod for Friday Night Funkin' (FNF). It features a storyline where characters are corrupted by a glitch, similar to the Pibby corruption concept. Players engage in rhythm battles to save the corrupted characters and restore order to the island. The mod includes custom songs, unique visuals, and challenging gameplay, making it a popular addition to the FNF modding community.

> **Note**: Mod seems to be going pretty slow, but overall still alive other than leaking problems...

another mod that I work on that reached 1 million views on youtube or more, the coding definitely could have been better on my part, but I joined when I was an amatuer, so I couldn't expect worse.

Overall, this project was one of the first bigger projects I joined, so im proud of where I am with it today.
