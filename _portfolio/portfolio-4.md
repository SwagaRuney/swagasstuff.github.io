title: "Sadistic Stories: Jaiden Animations"
excerpt: "Sadistic Stories is a Friday Night Funkin' mod where Jaiden Animations, corrupted by the Pibby glitch, becomes the central antagonist. Players, as Boyfriend, team up with characters like TheOdd1sOut to save her, battling through an intense song called Breaking Point in a glitchy, horror-themed environment.

> **Note**: Mod seems to be going pretty slow, but overall still alive other than leaking problems...

another  mod that I work on that reached 1 million views on youtube or more, the coding definitely could have been better on my part, but I joined when I was an amatuer, so I couldn't expect worse.

Overall, this project was one of the first bigger projects I joined, so im proud of where I am with it today.
