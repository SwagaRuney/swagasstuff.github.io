title: "No One is Safe"
excerpt: "No One Is Safe is a mod for Friday Night Funkin' (FNF) that features a creepy, bootleg-style SpongeBob theme. The mod's premise involves finding a strange flash drive containing poorly edited SpongeBob episodes and an unknown SpongeBob DVD ISO file. When the player runs the disc file, they encounter unsettling content. The mod was originally created for the 2024 Halloween Modjam and includes custom music, animations, and voice acting

> **Note**: one of my favorite mods, it also is with one of my best friends, so it makes me happy to be working on it!

A mod that i animated on, more of a technical demo than a full fledged mod, which i like!

however, im happy with how it turned out, i really do like it!
